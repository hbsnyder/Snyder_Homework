1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
It can be concluded that while theatre and music projects are the most successful overall, they also contain the largest amount of projects. Theatre also had the larget overall failures.
We see that trend continue with the sub-category data. The sub-category of plays has easily 3x more projects than any other sub-category.
I would also say that generally, there is a trend of growth in successful projects. This lends itself truthfully to the popularity of kickstarter today.


2. What are some limitations of this dataset?
The biggest limitation is that this dataset is out of date. I would also be curious to look closer at the individuals contributing to these fundraisers. There seems to be a niche in theatre, but there has to be something specific blocking them from success in other non-profit areas.


3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
It would be really interewting to compare dollar amounts, both when it comes to funds raised and goals set. I would love to dig deeper into what led projects to cancel as well.
